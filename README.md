Wanderlust â€“ Travel Listing Platform
A full-stack travel listing platform built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Passport.js, MapLibre GL JS, and OpenStreetMap API. Users can create, manage, and review travel listings with interactive maps, authentication, and more.

Features
User authentication using Passport.js.

Listing creation with images, pricing, and location details.

Interactive map views using MapLibre GL JS and OpenStreetMap API.

Reviews and ratings for each listing.

Centralized error handling and flash messaging.

Additional Notes
This app uses the MVC architecture to organize code and separate concerns.

For map integration, I used MapLibre GL JS and OpenStreetMap API as alternatives to Google Maps.

Authentication is session-based, using Passport.js for login and user management.

Future Improvements
Implement real-time features such as live chat or notifications for users.

Add additional filtering options for listings (e.g., price range, ratings).

Improve user interface with more advanced frontend tools.
